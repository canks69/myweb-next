> ## Short Explanation

Online Learning Application System is a learning method that combines direct (synchronous) learning with indirect or independent learning that can be done at any time (asynchronous). so the Online Learning Application System application system is designed to combine face-to-face learning and online learning

> ## Project Goals

The purpose of the Online Learning Application System System is to assist the teaching and learning process between teachers and students both in terms of providing materials that students can access, providing information on assignments given by the teacher and others. Where in this system has several advantages such as:

- More Flexible:
  The aim of implementing the Online Learning Application System method is to make learning more flexible. Of course this is different if you compare it with traditional learning. This method allows students to learn at their own pace

- Effective Learning Outcomes:
  Combining various teaching methods from the Online Learning Application System has been proven to be able to improve student learning outcomes. For example, based on research, students who are in elementary school and apply the Online Learning Application System Core5 for learning English show positive results. There is an increase in students' reading achievement of up to 20%.
- Increasing Student Interaction and Engagement
  Now many students are familiar with technology. They utilize this technology every day. Therefore, by utilizing technology when studying will make it easier for them to be involved in learning activities.

- Benefits of the Online Learning Application System, Able to Increase Learning Satisfaction
  In offline or traditional based learning, students tend to be passive when participating in learning. One reason is because the learning that takes place in the classroom is teacher-centered. On the other hand, you tend to rarely find this passivity in Online Learning Application Systems. Students tend to be active in participating and taking part in learning activities.
- Saves Costs and Time
  The blended learning model allows teachers and students to save more time and costs. This means that teachers can save on paper usage because learning activities can be carried out paperless. Teachers can use handouts, worksheets and other supports without having to print or duplicate them. Files related to the material just need to be uploaded, then students just need to download them via computer, laptop or cellphone. Teachers and students can also save more time because they don't need to travel to school, especially when the location from home to school is very far.
